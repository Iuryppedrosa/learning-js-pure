Welcome to the **Random Quote Generator**! This simple yet powerful application provides you with random quotes from an API and allows you to share them on Twitter.

## Features

- **Random Quotes:** Get a new inspirational quote every time you click the "New Quote" button.
- **Twitter Sharing:** Easily share your favorite quotes on Twitter with a single click.
- **Loading Indicator:** A smooth loading animation while fetching new quotes from the API.

## How It Works

1. **Fetching Quotes:** On load, the app fetches a list of quotes from the [Type.fit API](https://type.fit/api/quotes).
2. **Displaying Quotes:** A random quote is displayed along with its author. If the author is unknown, it displays "Unknown".
3. **Styling Quotes:** Quotes longer than 50 characters are styled differently to maintain a clean look.
4. **Tweeting Quotes:** Users can share quotes on Twitter using the "Tweet" button, which opens Twitter with the quote pre-filled.

## Usage

1. **New Quote:** Click the "New Quote" button to fetch and display a new random quote.
2. **Tweet Quote:** Click the "Tweet" button to share the current quote on Twitter.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** The core logic for fetching and displaying quotes.
- **HTML & CSS:** The structure and styling of the application.
- **Fetch API:** To retrieve quotes from an external API.
